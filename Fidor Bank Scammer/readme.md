# Fidor Scammer

One of our friends received a phishing mail from the Mail: **admin@asiahaat.com**

So we decided to help out :)

The site was done pretty nicely and our friend almost fell for it until he saw the Mail.

@AVISIX quickly wrote a small Python Script to fill his Database with random Junk

After spamming his Database with over 100 junk entries he decided to take down the Site

Here are a few Screenshots of how the Site looked (Quite good, if you are at the Fidor Bank)
